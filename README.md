# Real-time Noise Recognition and Reduction
The following code attempts to recognize periodic noise, and use active noise cancelling to reduce it. This project was developed during a computer science minor on real-time computing, the scope of this project was limited to a specific sample of a passing by train.

This project consists of four tasks: input, output, recognize and cancel.
